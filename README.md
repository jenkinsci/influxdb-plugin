## Description

Collects data from various other Jenkins plugins and sends metrics to InfluxDB. It's also
possible to send custom data inside pipeline jobs.

> :warning: From version 1.13 onwards different plugins are listed as optional
dependencies. In order to get rid of mandatory dependency errors,
the InfluxDB plugin must be re-installed.

> :warning: Breaking changes in 2.0
> - From version 2.0 onwards `selectedTarget` is a **mandatory** parameter
for pipelines and the `target` parameter is no longer supported.
> - Configuration As Code: the configuration needs to be changed from
`influxDbPublisher` to `influxDbGlobalConfig`.
> - Might cause issues when creating new targets in pipelines. The
`InfluxDbPublisher` instance is now
under jenkinsci.plugins.influxdb.**InfluxDbStep**.DescriptorImpl.

## Configuration

### Via Jenkins UI

Create a database in InfluxDB and a user with access rights. In Jenkins,
go to *Manage Jenkins \> Configure System \> InfluxDB Targets* and click
"Add". Provide the database information. The "URL" parameter requires
the whole URL of the InfluxDB database, including the `http(s)://` and the
database port. Also, provide the retention policy you want the data to
be stored in InfluxDB (e.g. `15m` or `2d`). By default, it is `infinite`.
Exceptions generated by the InfluxDB plugin can also be
ignored by deselecting the "Expose Exceptions" checkbox.

In your job, select "Publish build data to InfluxDB" from the post-build
actions.

### Via Jenkins Pipeline

From version 1.19 onwards, you can create and remove targets in pipelines directly.

```
// Get InfluxDB plugin descriptor (version < 2.0)
def influxdb = Jenkins.instance.getDescriptorByType(jenkinsci.plugins.influxdb.DescriptorImpl)

// version >= 2.0
def influxdb = Jenkins.instance.getDescriptorByType(jenkinsci.plugins.influxdb.InfluxDbStep.DescriptorImpl)

// Create target
def target = new jenkinsci.plugins.influxdb.models.Target()

// Set target details

// Mandatory fields
target.description = 'my-new-target'
target.url = 'http://influxdburl:8086'
target.username = 'my-username'

// version < 2.0
target.password = 'my-password'

// version >= 2.0
target.password = hudson.util.Secret.fromString('my-password')

target.database = 'my-database'

// Optional fields
target.retentionPolicy = '1d'                    // default = 'autogen'
target.jobScheduledTimeAsPointsTimestamp = true  // default = false
target.exposeExceptions = true                   // default = true
target.usingJenkinsProxy = true                  // default = false

// Add a target by using the created target object
influxdb.addTarget(target)
influxdb.save()

// Write stuff to InfluxDB
influxDbPublisher(selectedTarget: 'my-new-target')

// Remove a target by using the target description field value
influxdb.removeTarget('my-new-target')
influxdb.save()
```

## Usage

### Freestyle Jobs

Select the InfluxDB target you wish to publish the data to.

![](doc/img/select-influxdb-target.png)

From the "Advanced" tab you can choose to set a custom prefix for your `project_name` field,
a custom project name to be used instead of the default job name and custom fields and tags
for your `jenkins_data` metric.

![](doc/img/advanced-options.png)

### Pipelines

The plugin can be used by calling either the `influxDbPublisher()` or the `step()` function.

The `influxDbPublisher()` function is only supported from version 1.21 onwards.

**Pipeline syntax**

The only mandatory parameter is `selectedTarget`, which is the "Description" for your
target in the global configuration.

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
influxDbPublisher(selectedTarget: 'my-target')
```

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
step([$class: 'InfluxDbPublisher', selectedTarget: 'my-target'])
```

Optional parameters

- `customProjectName` (String) - custom project name
- `customPrefix` (String) - custom prefix for project name
- `customData` (Map) - custom fields in "jenkins_custom_data" measurement
- `customDataTags` (Map) - custom tags in "jenkins_custom_data" measurement
- `customDataMap` (Map) - custom fields in custom measurements
- `customDataMapTags` (Map) - custom tags in custom measurements
- `jenkinsEnvParameterField` (String) - custom fields in "jenkins_data" measurement (newline-separated KEY=VALUE pairs)
- `jenkinsEnvParameterTag` (String) - custom tags in "jenkins_data" measurement (newline-separated KEY=VALUE pairs)
- `measurementName` (String) - custom measurement name (replaces default "jenkins_data" and "jenkins_custom_data")

All `customData*` parameters contain custom data generated during the
build and not by the plugin, so they are not available in the snippet generator.


> :heavy_exclamation_mark: NOTE! Up to release 1.10.3, pipeline was configured with using the url and database.
>
>``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
>step([$class: 'InfluxDbPublisher',
>        target: 'http://127.0.0.1:8086,jenkins_db',
>        ...
>    ])
>```
> This form of configuration is not supported from version 1.11 onwards.

Pipelines don't have post-build actions, so the build result, build
ordinal, and the build success boolean will default to `"?"`, `5`,
and `false` respectively, unless set manually before calling `InfluxDbPublisher`.
Only the build result needs to be set manually, as the boolean value and ordinal are set
based on build result. Also, the build status will appear as `"?"` and the build
duration might be a little off, because the build is not actually finished.
If you want to get those pieces of information you need to configure the plugin
separately on each job as a post-build action. The jobs can be run with,
for example, the [Build Pipeline Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Pipeline+Plugin)
to get data from all jobs to InfluxDB. Alternatively, you can insert the
information in your build manually inside your Groovy script.

``` syntaxhighlighter-pre
try {
    // Build things here
    if (currentBuild.result == null) {
        currentBuild.result = 'SUCCESS' // sets the ordinal as 0 and boolean to true
    }
} catch (err) {
    if (currentBuild.result == null) {
        currentBuild.result = 'FAILURE' // sets the ordinal as 4 and boolean to false
    }
    throw err
} finally {
    influxDbPublisher(selectedTarget: 'my-target')
}
```

## Custom Data

You can write custom data to InfluxDB like this:

```
def myFields = [:]
myFields['field_a'] = 11
myFields['field_b'] = 12
influxDbPublisher(selectedTarget: 'my-target', customData: myFields)
```

This adds the fields `field_a` and `field_b` with values `11` and `12` respectively to a measurement called `jenkins_custom_data`.

You can also add tags to this measurement with the `customDataTags` parameter.

Alternatively, you can write custom data to InfluxDB with a higher degree of customization like this:

```
def myFields1 = [:]
def myFields2 = [:]
def myCustomMeasurementFields = [:]
myFields1['field_a'] = 11
myFields1['field_b'] = 12
myFields2['field_c'] = 21
myFields2['field_d'] = 22
myCustomMeasurementFields['series_1'] = myFields1
myCustomMeasurementFields['series_2'] = myFields2
influxDbPublisher(selectedTarget: 'my-target', customDataMap: myCustomMeasurementFields)
```

This creates 2 measurements, `series_1` and `series_2`.
It adds the fields `field_a` and `field_b` with values `11` and `12` respectively to measurement `series_1`.
It adds the fields `field_c` and `field_d` with values `21` and `22` respectively to measurement `series_2`.

You can also add tags to your custom measurements with the `customDataMapTags` parameter.
You **must** use the same map keys as measurement names as in `customDataMap`.
